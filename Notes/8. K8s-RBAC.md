# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes

RBAC is a key security feature in Kubernetes that helps manage access to cluster resources. It is divided into two main parts: **User Accounts** and **Service Accounts**. Proper RBAC implementation ensures that only authorized users or services can access, modify, or delete Kubernetes resources.

#### 1. RBAC Overview
- **User Accounts**: In a **local Kubernetes cluster** (e.g., Minikube or Kind), users get **admin access** by default. However, in **production or organizational setups**, access control needs to be explicitly defined to prevent unauthorized actions.
- **Service Accounts**: Service accounts are used by **pods** or other services in the cluster. They help ensure that a specific service or pod has the appropriate level of access to cluster resources without exposing unnecessary permissions.

Without defining proper access through RBAC, any team member (e.g., Dev or QA) could potentially perform critical operations like **deleting resources** (pods, deployments, etc.)—leading to security risks or operational mishaps.

#### 2. RBAC Elements

RBAC is managed through four main components:

- **Users or Service Accounts**: Define who or what has access (e.g., individual users, applications, or pods).
- **Roles / ClusterRoles**: Define what actions are allowed on resources.
- **RoleBindings / ClusterRoleBindings**: Bind roles or cluster roles to specific users or service accounts.
- **Access Control**: With RBAC, you can specify exactly which users or services have access to specific resources in the Kubernetes cluster.

#### 3. How Does RBAC Solve the Problem?
By defining roles, roles bindings, service accounts, and user permissions, you can restrict access to critical resources in a Kubernetes cluster. For example, the **Dev team** can be given permissions to deploy applications, but they won’t have access to delete resources like databases or critical services. The **QA team**, on the other hand, can have permissions to test the deployed applications but cannot modify infrastructure or services.

#### 4. Managing RBAC in Kubernetes

- **Service Accounts**: In Kubernetes, when you create resources like pods or deployments, a **service account** is automatically created to allow the pod to interact with the Kubernetes API. You can also define custom service accounts in your YAML files for specific roles.
  
- **Roles and ClusterRoles**: 
    - **Role**: A role defines a set of permissions within a **namespace** (i.e., a logical grouping of resources). For instance, a **role** can define permissions for managing only the resources within the `dev` namespace.
    - **ClusterRole**: A **cluster-wide role** defines permissions that apply across all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster. It’s useful for granting cluster-wide permissions (e.g., for admin tasks).
  
- **RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding**: 
    - **RoleBinding**: A role binding attaches a **Role** to a **specific user** or **service account** within a **namespace**.
    - **ClusterRoleBinding**: A cluster role binding attaches a **ClusterRole** to a **user** or **service account** across all namespaces in the cluster.

#### 5. Creating Users in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, you cannot directly create users. Instead, you use **Identity Providers** to manage user authentication and creation. These identity providers authenticate users before they can access the Kubernetes cluster. For example:
  - **AWS EKS**: If you are using **Amazon EKS**, you can use **IAM users** to log in. To authenticate, you need to set up an **IAM OAuth provider** in your AWS account.
  - **LDAP, Okta, SSO**: For organizations using other identity providers like **LDAP**, **Okta**, or **SSO**, Kubernetes can authenticate users through an external service by using an identity provider like **Keycloak**.

#### 6. Setting Up IAM OAuth Provider (for AWS EKS)

If you are using **Amazon EKS**, authentication is handled via AWS **IAM roles**. To enable Kubernetes access using IAM users:
1. **Create IAM users and roles**: In the AWS console, create IAM users and roles with appropriate permissions for Kubernetes access.
2. **Set up the IAM OIDC provider**: In EKS, you need to establish an **OIDC (OpenID Connect) provider** to securely link IAM roles to Kubernetes service accounts.
3. **Associate IAM roles with service accounts**: With the OIDC provider in place, associate your Kubernetes service accounts with IAM roles to grant permissions.
   
This allows you to use **AWS IAM** as your identity provider for Kubernetes, ensuring that only users with the right IAM roles can access your cluster.

#### 7. Using Keycloak as an Identity Provider

For organizations using **LDAP**, **Okta**, or **SSO** services, **Keycloak** is a popular open-source identity provider that can be integrated with Kubernetes for user authentication. Here’s how:
1. **Set up Keycloak**: Install Keycloak on a server or use a hosted version.
2. **Configure Kubernetes to use Keycloak**: Kubernetes needs to be configured to trust Keycloak as the identity provider. This is done by configuring **OIDC** in the Kubernetes API server.
3. **Define roles and bindings**: After authentication via Keycloak, use Kubernetes **Roles** and **RoleBindings** to assign permissions to authenticated users based on their roles in Keycloak.

#### 8. Service Account Creation in Kubernetes

Service accounts are used by applications and services (like pods) to authenticate against the Kubernetes API server. By default, when you create a pod or deployment, Kubernetes automatically assigns it a service account.
  
If you need specific permissions for a pod or service, you can create a **custom service account** in the **YAML file**. Here’s an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-custom-service-account
```

This YAML file defines a **custom service account**. You can then bind this service account to roles using **RoleBinding** or **ClusterRoleBinding**.

#### 9. Granting Access to Users or Service Accounts

To assign permissions to users or service accounts, you follow this process:

- **Step 1: Create a Role or ClusterRole**:
    - For namespace-specific permissions, define a **Role**.
    - For cluster-wide permissions, define a **ClusterRole**.

Example (creating a Role):
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: dev
  name: dev-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

- **Step 2: Create a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding** to attach the Role or ClusterRole to users or service accounts.

Example (binding a Role to a service account):
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: dev-role-binding
  namespace: dev
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: my-custom-service-account
  namespace: dev
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: dev-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

This **RoleBinding** attaches the **dev-role** to the service account `my-custom-service-account`, granting it the specified permissions within the `dev` namespace.

#### 10. Conclusion

RBAC in Kubernetes allows you to manage user and service account access with fine-grained control, ensuring that only authorized users or services can access specific resources. Using identity providers like AWS IAM or Keycloak, you can authenticate users and service accounts securely, and by creating roles and bindings, you can ensure that users only have access to the resources they need to perform their jobs. Properly managing access through RBAC is essential for maintaining security and operational efficiency in a Kubernetes environment.
