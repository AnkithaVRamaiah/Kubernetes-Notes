# **Custom Resources in Kubernetes**

**Why Custom Resources?**

Kubernetes comes with many built-in resources like deployments, services, and config maps. These resources cover many typical use cases. However, there are scenarios where Kubernetes might not provide an out-of-the-box resource to meet your needs. This is where **Custom Resources (CRs)** come into play.

Custom Resources allow you to extend Kubernetes by adding your own resource types. This helps in handling more specialized or unique requirements that aren't covered by the default resources.

### **Actors Involved in Custom Resources**

There are two primary actors involved in working with Custom Resources:

1. **DevOps Engineer**: Responsible for deploying **Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)** and **Custom Controllers**.
2. **User**: After the CRD is deployed, users can create or use the custom resources.

### **How Kubernetes Extends its Functionality with Custom Resources**

Kubernetes provides three key components to enable extension via Custom Resources:
1. **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**: Defines the schema of the custom resource.
2. **Custom Resource (CR)**: Represents an instance of the custom resource defined by the CRD.
3. **Custom Controller**: Watches for changes to custom resources and takes action.

Together, these components help extend Kubernetes' functionality and automate operations on custom resources.

### **Detailed Breakdown of Each Component**

#### 1. **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**

- **What is it?**
  - The **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)** defines a new resource type for Kubernetes. It specifies the structure, validation, and schema for the custom resource.
  - It is written in a YAML file, similar to the way you define built-in resources like deployments or services. This YAML file is submitted to the Kubernetes API to register the new custom resource type.

- **Example**:
  - If you wanted to create a custom resource called `Database`, you would define the resource's structure, fields, and validation in a CRD YAML file.

- **Why is it important?**
  - The CRD essentially tells Kubernetes how to treat the custom resource, what fields are required, and any validation rules.
  - Once the CRD is registered with the Kubernetes API, it allows users to create instances of that resource type (Custom Resources).

#### 2. **Custom Resource (CR)**

- **What is it?**
  - A **Custom Resource (CR)** is an instance of a resource defined by a CRD. After the CRD is deployed, you can create multiple instances of your custom resource.
  - For example, if your CRD defines a `Database` resource, a Custom Resource could represent an individual database instance (e.g., `my-database`).

- **Validation**:
  - Kubernetes automatically validates CRs against their associated CRDs. If a user tries to create a Custom Resource with incorrect or missing fields, Kubernetes will reject it.

- **Why is it important?**
  - Custom Resources allow you to define and manage resources specific to your application needs, similar to how Kubernetes manages built-in resources like Pods or Deployments.

---

#### 3. **Custom Controller**

- **What is it?**
  - A **Custom Controller** is responsible for managing and acting upon changes to the custom resource. The controller watches the custom resource for changes (e.g., creation, modification, deletion) and takes actions based on the resource state.
  - For example, when a `Database` custom resource is created, the custom controller might create a corresponding database instance on an external system or provision necessary storage resources.

- **Why is it important?**
  - A custom controller automates the management of the custom resource, ensuring that the desired state is always maintained. It behaves like Kubernetes' built-in controllers (e.g., ReplicaSet Controller, Deployment Controller) that manage standard resources.

### **Process of Working with Custom Resources**

1. **Create and Deploy the Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**:
   - The DevOps engineer writes the CRD in YAML format and deploys it to Kubernetes. This step defines the structure, validation, and schema for the custom resource.

2. **Create Custom Resources (CRs)**:
   - Once the CRD is deployed, users can create instances of the custom resource (CRs). These instances are validated by Kubernetes against the CRD to ensure they follow the correct structure.

3. **Deploy the Custom Controller**:
   - The custom controller is written (often in Go) and deployed to Kubernetes. It watches for changes to the custom resources and takes action to ensure the desired state is maintained.

---

### **How to Write a Custom Controller**

1. **Define the Custom Resource**:
   - The first step is to write a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) that defines the structure and schema of the custom resource.

2. **Develop the Custom Controller**:
   - The controller is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the custom resources. It can be written using the **Kubernetes Go client**. The controller will watch for events (e.g., create, update, delete) related to the custom resource and then take the necessary action.

3. **Deploy the Custom Controller**:
   - Once the custom controller is written, it is deployed into the Kubernetes cluster. It begins watching for the custom resources it manages and performs actions (such as scaling, provisioning, or managing external services).

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Use Cases for Custom Resources**:
  - Custom Resources are often used to manage resources that are outside the scope of Kubernetes' default resources. Examples include managing complex application deployments, creating custom databases, or integrating with third-party services like cloud providers, databases, or other systems.
  
- **Interacting with Custom Resources**:
  - After the CRD and Custom Resources are set up, users can interact with them using `kubectl` commands just like any other Kubernetes resource. For example, `kubectl get databases` could list all instances of the `Database` custom resource.

- **Namespace vs. Cluster-wide Resources**:
  - Custom Resources can be either **namespaced** (specific to a Kubernetes namespace) or **cluster-wide** (available across the entire cluster). This choice depends on the use case and whether the resource should be scoped to a specific namespace or shared across the cluster.

### **Summary**

Custom Resources (CRs) in Kubernetes allow you to extend Kubernetes' API to manage custom resources. This is done through:
1. **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**: Defines the schema and validation for the new resource type.
2. **Custom Resource (CR)**: An instance of the custom resource, validated by Kubernetes.
3. **Custom Controller**: Watches and manages the lifecycle of custom resources.

Custom Resources enable Kubernetes to manage specialized workloads or integrate with third-party systems, extending its capabilities beyond its default resources.
