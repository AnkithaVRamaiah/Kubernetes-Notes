# Migrating to Kubernetes: Challenges with Load Balancing

## Traditional Application Deployment

### **Before Kubernetes: Legacy Systems and Load Balancers**

In the traditional setup, applications were often deployed on **virtual machines (VMs)** or even **physical servers**. Each application would run on its dedicated hardware or virtualized environment, making it necessary to manage the distribution of incoming requests effectively.

### **Load Balancers in Traditional Systems**

To manage traffic and ensure that no single server was overwhelmed, companies used **load balancers**. These devices or software applications distributed incoming network traffic across multiple servers to enhance the responsiveness and availability of applications.

## Common Features of Traditional Load Balancers

Load balancers like **Nginx**, **F5**, or other enterprise-grade solutions offered various advanced features to optimize and secure application delivery. Here's how they worked:

### **1. Ratio-Based Load Balancing**

This feature allowed traffic to be distributed across servers based on predefined ratios. For example, one server could handle 70% of the traffic while another handled 30%. This setup was useful when servers had different capacities or were in different stages of readiness.

### **2. Sticky Sessions**

Also known as **session persistence**, this feature ensured that all requests from the same user would go to the same server. This was crucial for applications that maintained session data locally on the server, like user login sessions.

### **3. Path-Based Load Balancing**

This feature directed traffic to different servers based on the URL path. For instance, requests to `/api` could be routed to one server cluster, while `/images` could go to another. It allowed for better resource allocation and optimization.

### **4. Host-Based Load Balancing**

Similar to path-based routing, this feature allowed requests to be directed based on the domain name. For example, `www.example.com` and `api.example.com` could be served by different server groups.

### **5. Whitelisting and Blacklisting**

To enhance security, load balancers could control access by allowing or denying requests based on IP addresses or other criteria. This feature was vital for protecting applications from unauthorized access.

### **6. Security Enhancements**

Load balancers often handled **TLS termination**, decrypting incoming SSL/TLS traffic and then passing it to the backend servers. This offloaded the computational burden of encryption from the servers, improving performance and security.

## Challenges with Load Balancing in Kubernetes

When migrating to **Kubernetes**, a container orchestration platform, the approach to load balancing changes significantly, leading to several challenges:

- **Dynamic Scaling**: Kubernetes dynamically scales pods (containers) up and down, which can make it challenging to maintain features like sticky sessions.
- **Ingress Controllers**: Instead of traditional load balancers, Kubernetes uses **Ingress Controllers** (like Nginx Ingress) to handle incoming traffic, which might lack some advanced features initially.
- **Service Discovery**: Kubernetes uses services for internal load balancing, which works differently from traditional IP-based routing.

### After Migration to Kubernetes

#### Initial Benefits

When we migrated to Kubernetes, we quickly noticed several impressive features that improved our system's reliability and scalability:

1. **Auto-Healing**: Kubernetes automatically detected when a container failed and restarted it to ensure the application remained available and functional without manual intervention.
  
2. **Auto-Scaling**: The platform could automatically scale up or down the number of application instances based on demand, optimizing resource usage and ensuring smooth performance during traffic spikes.

3. **Automatic Service Discovery**: Kubernetes made it easier for different parts of the application to find and communicate with each other. It automatically kept track of service endpoints and provided a consistent mechanism for services to connect.

4. **Simplified Load Balancing with kube-proxy**: Kubernetes services used a component called **kube-proxy** to distribute network traffic among the available pods. It employed a round-robin method to balance requests, updating IP tables dynamically to manage traffic distribution efficiently.

#### Limitations

However, as we dove deeper into Kubernetes, we encountered some limitations, particularly in the area of load balancing and cost management:

1. **Simplistic Load Balancing**: 
    - The **round-robin load balancing** provided by Kubernetes services was basic and worked well for simple use cases.
    - But, it fell short when compared to **enterprise-grade load balancers**, which offer more advanced features like traffic shaping, session persistence, and intelligent routing based on user location or request type.

2. **Cost Issues with Load Balancer Services**:
    - In Kubernetes, using **LoadBalancer type services** meant that each service needed its own **static public IP address**.
    - While this setup made services easily accessible from the internet, it introduced a significant cost burden.
    - **Cloud providers** typically charge for each static IP, and as the number of services grew, these charges accumulated rapidly, leading to **high operational costs**.

### Problems Identified in Current Load Balancing Setup

#### **Problem 1: Lack of Advanced Load Balancing Features**

In many modern applications, the load balancer does more than just distribute traffic evenly across servers. Let's explore the missing features that are critical for robust and flexible load balancing:

1. **Ratio-Based Load Balancing**:
   - This feature allows traffic to be distributed based on predefined ratios. For instance, if you want 70% of traffic to go to one server and 30% to another, ratio-based load balancing makes this possible. It's crucial for scenarios where servers have different capacities or priorities.

2. **Sticky Sessions**:
   - Also known as session persistence, this feature ensures that once a user is connected to a specific server, all subsequent requests from that user go to the same server. This is essential for applications that store session-specific data locally on a server, such as user login sessions or shopping cart data.

3. **Path-Based and Host-Based Routing**:
   - **Path-Based Routing**: This directs traffic to different servers based on the URL path. For example, requests to `/api` might go to one server, while `/images` go to another.
   - **Host-Based Routing**: This directs traffic based on the hostname. For example, traffic to `app1.example.com` might be handled differently than `app2.example.com`.
   - These features enable more efficient use of server resources and better traffic management.

4. **Advanced Security Options like TLS Termination**:
   - **TLS Termination**: This means that the load balancer handles the decryption of incoming HTTPS requests, reducing the load on backend servers.
   - It simplifies the management of SSL/TLS certificates and enhances security by offloading the encryption workload from the servers.

5. **Enterprise-Level Load Balancing Features**:
   - Other advanced features include health checks, failover capabilities, and DDoS protection, which are often necessary for enterprise-grade applications to ensure high availability and reliability.

#### **Problem 2: High Costs with LoadBalancer Type Services**

Using the LoadBalancer service type in Kubernetes can be convenient, but it comes with significant cost implications, especially at scale:

1. **Static Public IP Costs**:
   - Every LoadBalancer service in Kubernetes typically requires its own **static public IP**. These static IPs come with ongoing costs.
   - For small-scale deployments, this might not be an issue. However, as the number of services grows, the costs can quickly add up.

2. **Cost Accumulation for Large Deployments**:
   - For organizations running **thousands of services**, each requiring a LoadBalancer service with a static IP, the costs become exorbitant. This is a stark contrast to traditional setups.

3. **Comparison with Legacy Systems**:
   - In **legacy setups**, a single load balancer could manage traffic for multiple applications, significantly reducing the need for numerous static IPs.
   - This approach not only lowers costs but also simplifies network management and reduces the complexity of handling many public IP addresses.

### Introduction to Ingress in Kubernetes

**What is Ingress?**

Ingress in Kubernetes is a specialized resource designed to manage **external access** to the services running inside a Kubernetes cluster. It acts as a smart entry point that handles requests coming from the internet and routes them to the appropriate services within the cluster. In simpler terms, Ingress is like a traffic controller, guiding external traffic to the right destination based on specific rules.

#### Key Features of Ingress:
- **Advanced Routing**: Ingress allows complex routing rules based on URLs or domain names.
- **Load Balancing**: It distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend services.
- **TLS Termination**: Ingress can handle HTTPS traffic, providing security by terminating TLS (Transport Layer Security).
- **Integration with External Systems**: It can integrate with external DNS and certificates for seamless domain management.

### How Ingress Solves Common Kubernetes Challenges

1. **Enhanced Load Balancing Capabilities**

In traditional Kubernetes setups, each service can have its own LoadBalancer, which is basic and lacks advanced features. Ingress offers **advanced load balancing** capabilities such as:

- **Path-based Routing**: Different URLs can route to different services. For example, requests to `example.com/app1` can go to `Service A`, while `example.com/app2` goes to `Service B`.
- **Host-based Routing**: Traffic can be directed based on the host header. For instance, `api.example.com` might lead to `API Service`, and `web.example.com` to `Web Service`.
- **Sticky Sessions**: Ensures a user’s request is consistently directed to the same service instance, useful for stateful applications.
- **TLS Termination**: Ingress can terminate TLS, meaning it handles HTTPS requests and forwards them as HTTP to services, simplifying the internal network configuration.

These features make Ingress comparable to **enterprise-level load balancers**, providing a robust solution for managing traffic in complex environments.

2. **Cost Efficiency**

One of the significant advantages of using Ingress is its potential for **cost savings** in cloud environments. Here's how:

- **Shared External IP**: Instead of assigning a unique external IP to each service with a LoadBalancer, Ingress allows multiple services to share a single external IP. This is particularly useful in environments where public IP addresses are a limited and costly resource.
- **Reduced Infrastructure Overhead**: By consolidating the routing logic into a single Ingress resource, the need for multiple LoadBalancer resources is eliminated, reducing cloud costs and simplifying management.

This approach minimizes the number of **static public IP addresses** required, leading to substantial savings, especially in large-scale deployments.

### Conclusion

Ingress is a powerful feature in Kubernetes that enhances the cluster's ability to handle external traffic efficiently. By offering advanced routing, TLS termination, and shared public IPs, Ingress provides both **technical sophistication** and **cost benefits**. For anyone managing a Kubernetes environment, understanding and implementing Ingress can significantly improve both the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of their deployments.

### Recap of Key Points

- **Problem 1**: Kubernetes services lacked the advanced load balancing features available in enterprise systems.
- **Problem 2**: High costs due to the need for a static public IP for each LoadBalancer service.
- **Ingress** was introduced to solve these issues by providing advanced load balancing capabilities and reducing the number of required static IPs.

# 1. **Introduction to the Problem:**
   - **Background:** Many users who migrated from virtual machines to Kubernetes faced challenges with load balancing. Virtual machines provided built-in capabilities like load balancing, which contributed to improved security and cost-efficiency. However, these features were missing or difficult to implement when moving to Kubernetes.
   - **User Feedback:** Kubernetes users raised complaints, highlighting the need for similar load-balancing features as those provided by virtual machines.

### 2. **Kubernetes Response:**
   - **Kubernetes' Solution:** In response, Kubernetes introduced the **Ingress** resource. This resource allows Kubernetes users to define rules for routing traffic to services within the cluster.
   - **Ingress Resource:** An Ingress resource is essentially a configuration file (typically in YAML format) that defines how external HTTP(S) traffic should be routed to internal services based on specific rules (like path-based routing).

### 3. **The Role of Load Balancers:**
   - **Load Balancer Providers:** Many popular load balancer solutions, such as **Nginx**, **F5**, and **HAProxy**, were already being used by Kubernetes users for handling traffic and load balancing in their traditional VM-based environments.
   - **Kubernetes Limitation:** Kubernetes cannot support every load balancer natively, as there are numerous options available, and supporting all of them would be challenging.

### 4. **Introducing the Ingress Controller:**
   - **Ingress Controller Concept:** To address this challenge, Kubernetes introduced the concept of the **Ingress Controller**. The Ingress Controller is a specialized component that watches for the Ingress resources created by users and translates these resources into specific routing logic.
   - **Role of Ingress Controller:** The Ingress Controller is responsible for implementing the path-based routing defined in the Ingress resource and ensuring that traffic is directed to the appropriate services within the Kubernetes cluster.

### 5. **How Ingress Works:**
   - **Creating an Ingress Resource:** As a Kubernetes user, you can define an Ingress resource (via YAML file) that specifies the routing rules, such as path-based routing (e.g., `example.com/path1` routes to one service, `example.com/path2` routes to another).
   - **Ingress Controller Deployment:** You can choose a specific Ingress Controller, such as Nginx, and deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster. This can be done using Helm charts or YAML manifests.
   - **Ingress Controller’s Role:** Once deployed, the Ingress Controller listens for changes to the Ingress resource and ensures that the routing rules are applied correctly, based on the load balancer's configuration.

### 6. **Benefits of Ingress and Ingress Controllers:**
   - **Flexibility:** Kubernetes users can select the load balancer (Ingress Controller) that best fits their needs.
   - **Path-Based Routing:** Users can implement advanced routing features like path-based routing, which was commonly used in virtual machine environments.
   - **Cost-Effectiveness and Security:** By using Ingress and Ingress Controllers, Kubernetes can provide a more cost-effective and secure load balancing solution compared to traditional VM-based setups.

### Summary:
Kubernetes addressed the gap in load balancing capabilities by introducing the **Ingress resource** and the **Ingress Controller**. This approach allows Kubernetes users to define routing rules while choosing from a range of load balancer solutions. The Ingress Controller ensures that the routing rules are implemented and helps restore some of the benefits previously enjoyed in VM-based environments, such as path-based routing.

# Simplified
---

Before Kubernetes, developers and DevOps engineers deployed applications on virtual machines (VMs) or physical servers. On top of these VMs, they often used load balancers provided by companies like Nginx, F5, and others. These load balancers offered a variety of capabilities, including load balancing, sticky sessions, path-based routing, and host-based routing. 

When Kubernetes came into the picture, it introduced features like auto-scaling, auto-healing, and load balancing for services. However, even though Kubernetes provides load balancing, it uses a round-robin algorithm by default. This basic load balancing isn't as sophisticated as the enterprise-level load balancers offered by third-party providers, and cloud providers charge for using static IP addresses with services like LoadBalancer. This led to some concerns and complaints from users about the lack of advanced load balancing features and the costs involved.

To address these challenges, Kubernetes introduced **Ingress**. Ingress provides a way to manage external access to services within a Kubernetes cluster, offering capabilities like path-based and host-based routing, and it allows for more advanced routing rules that were previously handled by enterprise load balancers.

However, Kubernetes itself does not have built-in, enterprise-level load balancing capabilities. Instead, it relies on third-party load balancers like Nginx, F5, and others to create an **Ingress controller**. The Ingress controller is responsible for handling the routing of external traffic into the Kubernetes cluster based on the rules specified in the Ingress resource.

In this setup:
1. The **Ingress controller** is deployed inside the Kubernetes cluster. It can be provided by third-party vendors like Nginx or F5, or even open-source options.
2. The **Ingress resource**, which is a Kubernetes object (typically defined in a YAML file), specifies the routing rules and other configurations, such as which services should receive traffic and how to route it (e.g., based on URL paths or hostnames).

The **Ingress controller** continuously watches the **Ingress resources** and implements the necessary routing and load balancing based on the configurations defined in the YAML file. This allows Kubernetes to provide more sophisticated load balancing and routing features, without incurring the extra costs of static IP addresses or relying on the default round-robin mechanism of the Kubernetes service-type LoadBalancer.
