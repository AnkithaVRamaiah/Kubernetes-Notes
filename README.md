# RoadMap

### **1. Basics of Kubernetes**
- **Introduction to Kubernetes**
  - Understand what Kubernetes is and its use cases.
  - Learn about the Kubernetes architecture, including Master and Worker nodes.
- **Key Components**
  - **Pods**: The smallest deployable units in K8s.
  - **ReplicaSets**: Ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running.
  - **Deployments**: Manage the deployment of applications.
  - **Services**: Expose a set of pods as a network service.
  - **Namespaces**: Separate resources into different logical groups.

### **2. Kubernetes Installation and Setup**
- **Minikube**: Set up a local Kubernetes cluster for practice.
- **Kubeadm**: Install Kubernetes on a multi-node cluster.
- **Cloud-based K8s**: Set up clusters using managed services like AWS EKS, Azure AKS, or Google GKE.

### **3. Managing Applications in Kubernetes**
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Manage configuration data and sensitive information.
- **Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**: Handle storage in K8s.
- **StatefulSets**: Deploy stateful applications.
- **DaemonSets**: Ensure a copy of a pod runs on all or some nodes.
- **Jobs and CronJobs**: Run batch jobs and scheduled tasks.

### **4. Kubernetes Networking**
- **Services**: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer.
- **Ingress**: Manage external access to services in the cluster.
- **Network Policies**: Control the network access to and from pods.

### **5. Monitoring and Logging**
- **Monitoring Tools**: Learn to use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- **Logging**: Understand how to aggregate and view logs using tools like Fluentd or ELK stack.

### **6. Security in Kubernetes**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Manage access control.
- **Pod Security Policies**: Define security rules for pods.
- **Network Policies**: Implement fine-grained network security.

### **7. Advanced Kubernetes Concepts**
- **Helm**: Use Helm for templating and managing K8s applications.
- **Operators**: Automate complex application deployments using Operators.
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)**: Extend the Kubernetes API.

### **8. Kubernetes in CI/CD**
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate Kubernetes with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Argo CD.
- **GitOps**: Implement GitOps practices using Argo CD or Flux.

### **9. Kubernetes Best Practices**
- **Resource Limits and Requests**: Set resource quotas for pods.
- **Namespace Segregation**: Use namespaces to isolate environments.
- **Cluster Autoscaling**: Enable cluster and pod autoscaling.
- **Backup and Restore**: Learn to backup and restore your cluster using tools like Velero.

### **10. Troubleshooting and Debugging**
- **Logs and Events**: Use `kubectl logs` and `kubectl describe` to debug issues.
- **CrashLoopBackOff**: Investigate and resolve common errors.

### **11. Certification (Optional but Recommended)**
- **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)**
- **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)**
